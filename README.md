# Relay-and-Antenna-Selection-Algorithms-for-MIMO-Networks
This repo is simulation of the research paper titled "Joint Relay-and-Antenna Selection in Multi-Antenna Relay Networks"


• Implemented a joint relay-and-antenna selection algorithm for a MIMO network with multiple half duplex relays.
• The scheme improved the outage probability performance of the relay networks compared to sub-optimal schemes.
• Achieved a 99% match by validating results through theoretical derivation and comparison with numerical results.
